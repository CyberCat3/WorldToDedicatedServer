# WorldToDedicatedServer
 A tool that converts Minecraft worlds to dedicated servers.

It should be simple to use, simply select the version, the path to the world and the destination for the server.
Then click the convert button and it will handle the rest.

### Warning
This tool actually no longer works. mcversions.net, the page I used for tracking Minecraft releases, changed their layout, and now my program doesn't know how to use it :-(

Instead, use [this](https://github.com/CyberCat3/MinecraftServerCreator)
